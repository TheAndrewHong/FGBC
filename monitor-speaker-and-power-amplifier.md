# Monitor Speaker & Power Amplifier

## 1. Stage Monitor Speaker \(Calculating I**mpedance**\)

* 250W/1000W/8 ohms Monitor Speaker
* TRS: Balanced
* TS: Unbalanced
* 반드시 TRS로 Balanced 시그널로 전송.
* [Balanced vs. Unbalanced](http://caugpc.tistory.com/166)

**Dial on Peavy 112TLM**: Knob used to adjust the tweeter

Tweeter for high frequencies

Woofer for low and mid-range frequencies



**Calculate the combined impedance of all speakers used each amp channel**

* Impedance of one speaker / Total number of speakers

\(Assuming all speakers are the same\)

## **White Noise?**

* Caused by the gain, or amplification, turned up too high at some point,

## 2. Power Amp

**Need amp that can produce at least 100 watts per channel into an 8-ohm load**

**All About Ohms: Ohms - Measure of Resistance**

### Set-Up: Two speakers per amp

* Two 8-ohm speakers running in parallel = 8/2 = 4 ohms
* "Take the ohm rating for the speakers and divide by the number of speakers."

### Quick Reference listing of Commonly Used Parallel Loads: 

* Two 16-ohm speakers = 8 ohm
* Two 8-ohm speakers = 4 ohm
* Two 4-ohm speakers = 2 ohm 
* Three 16-ohm speakers = 5.33 ohm
* Three 8-ohm speakers = 2.67 ohm
* Three 4-ohm speakers = 1.3 ohm 
* Four 16-ohm speakers = 4 ohm
* Four 8-ohm speakers = 2 ohm
* Four 4-ohm speakers = 1 ohm
