# Compressor

## Threshold

Compressor reduces the level of audio that exceeds certain threshold

Lower threshold -&gt; Larger portion of signal will be treated

Reduce only the loudest part of the signal -&gt; Use higher threshold setting

## Ratio

Controls strength of the compression

</table>## Attack

Speed which the compressor reacts once the threshold has been exceeded

**Shorter Attack**:        Make signal reduction quicker

**Longer Attack**:        Have longer gradual increases in reduction

## Release

Opposite of Attach

Controls how quickly/slowly level returns to uncompressed once the signal falls back below threshold

## Makeup Gain

Output volume control

Used to bring overall level backup

## 1-Knob Compression

Keep between 9 and 12 o'clock on vocals, keys, and guitars, none on bass

Most useful on vocals

Most people get louder when they sing higher, the compression keeps that reined in.
